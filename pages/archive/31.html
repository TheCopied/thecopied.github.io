		<p>This album consists of 7 tracks with an accompanying assortment of 7 digital images. The images were all derived from a single stock photo of the keyboard used to make the sounds in the album -- a Leopold FC750R. These iterations were created in GIMP. These images seek to enhace or emphasize aspects of the photo, and through this process ultimately destroy the image.</p>
		
		<p>The tracks were composed in FL Studio, and were made using a mixture of samples, software instruments, and plug-ins. Often audio files were exported to then be reused as samples, therefore increasing the scale of various effects. The speech was made using a free browser text-to-speech generator. The album was inspired by the metaverse entering public discussions and awareness following the creation of Meta from Facebook.</p>
		
		<p>There is present in the album both a concern for and enjoyment of a sense of decay; both a fear and a disgust at our potential trajectory towards virtuality, as well as a sense that art can be squeezed from even rotting fabrics.</p>

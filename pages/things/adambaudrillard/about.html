    <h1>Adam Baudrillard: The Art Project</h1>
    <p>During the COVID-19 panic and pandemic, many (like this author) were forced to spend even <i>more</i> time than usual on the Internet.
    In light of that, I decided to create a fake profile (based of a New Yorker profile). The purpose was to highlight the ways in which living is mediated by these powerful technologies, many times in ways we are not fully aware of.</p>
    <p>The back-end of the website was made without adding any code of my own. By simply editing webpages using the Chrome <i>Inspect</i> function, I changed links, deleted sections, and copied chunks of code from various New Yorker webpages. I added nothing of my own design to the structure or HTML - everything was either copied (if I could figure out how to use it with a single HTML text) or simply deleted (if I could not). The site was hosted on repl.it (and still is available <a href="https://AdamBaudrillard.theneweryork.repl.co">here</a>, though that page is not maintained or updated.) Now, it is part of a larger GitHub pages website.</p>
    <p>All images were taken by my friend, and converted to Base64 for the HTML (obscene, I know. I'm the one who has to load the HTML file to edit it. Not pretty).</p>
    <p>I obviously own no rights to any New Yorker property. Everything was used for purely artistic and satirical means. I own nothing, and make no money from this. </p>
    <p>I did my best to preserve the outward appearence of a New Yorker website, only editing what was too complicated for me or what did not fit my purposes. As such, the content of the profile is only part of the project - the underbelly of links to various websites is as important. Viewing on a computer is preferable to a phone since there is more content, but mobile viewing is also supported.</p>
    <p>All links were chosen for specific ends, typically to try and force some rumination on the nature of this technology. All linked websites were found using a combination of:<br>
    1) My own knowledge<br>
    2) <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/f937om/what_is_the_coolest_website_youve_visited_that_no/">Reddit threads</a><br>
    3) Website aggregators such as <a href="https://theuselessweb.com/">TheUselessWeb</a> and <a href="https://makeawebsitehub.com/weird-websites/">MakeAWebsiteHub</a>. There are many of these kinds of websites, and I indubitably have neglected some that I inadvertantly got URLs from.<br>
    <p> I purposely chose to link only 1 NSFW website (visible only on Desktop), which I tagged as such. I thought a lot about this, but decided that people already know that there is porn (and worse) everywhere. There exists a dark side to the Internet that isn't just Gore or Shock content. The purpose of this project is to make you think, explore, and discover- not make you vomit.</p>
